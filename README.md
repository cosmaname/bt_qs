# BT QS

Google changed Bluetooth QS tile in Android 14.
I've been asked to make same simple tile as my previous [WiFi QS](https://github.com/rostopira/wifi_qs) project.

Target API 30 is required to allow this app to turn Bluetooth on and off without extra permission.
I can't publish this in Google Play, since it requires minimum target API 33.

# FAQ

## I want Wi-Fi tile

Check out [WiFi QS](https://github.com/rostopira/wifi_qs).

## I don't have root, what about Shizuku

Use [Better Internet Tiles](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.casperverswijvelt.unifiedinternetqs)

I'm not going to rewrite it using shizuku

## I have feature request

I don't have time for that. PR's are welcome
